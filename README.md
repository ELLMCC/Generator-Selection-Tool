# Generator-Selection-Tool
A tool for selecting a commercial generator for a small wind turbine
Generators live in the generator script
Run the selector having inputted the different test scenarios found at the bottom of the script before the for loop
it will grab the generators from the generator script and apply the wind profile, turbine radius, and gear ratio specified
please contact me if you have issues running it.
